---Control---
Cannot control the perspective when the animation is running. After the animation, you can use direction keys to control the movement:
"up" and "down" can move toward and back, "left" and "right" can control the direction in horizontal.
“t” or “T” can stop the animation when it is running.
“c” or “C” can switch scenes.
“o” or “O” can show the steps I did to design the objects.
